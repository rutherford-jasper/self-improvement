# self-improvement

ok so the idea is to improve myself in pretty much any small way every day [probably every weekday...]


things like:
- learning new language
- learning new feature of your editor to be more efficient
- finding a way to use kb instead of mouse
- learning a new tool (e.g. debugger, strace, dtrace, ebpf)
- learning more about tools we already use (e.g. docker, compose, bash, make, Go)
- reading papers
- learn more math, prob and stats, discreet math
- learn more data structures and algos
