10.18.24 
- Made repo
- VS Code switch to terminal: ctrl + `
- VS Code switch to editor: cmd + 1
- vscode switch terminals: option + cmd + <arrow>

10.21.24
- Theres this vs code thing "command pallette"
- access by doing cmd + shift + p
- kinda crazy flexible thing for loads of cool commands
- you can start with @ to search for symbols (variables, functions, etc)

10.22.24
- vim hotkey to go to end of file: G
- vim hotkey to go to top of file: gg
- slack add reaction to latest message in channel: cmd + shift + \
- slack add reaction to selected message: r
- slack go to conversation: cmd + k
- slack see all unread messages: cmd + shift + a
- slack open/create thread for selected message: t
- vim go forward a word: w
- vim go back a word: b

10.23.24
- learned about git stash concepts/commands (up to now it's basically just been a spooky nebulous idea)
- git stash: stashes changes. i knew this one already
- git stash push -m "message": stashes changes with a message
- git stash list: list all stashes
- git stash apply: apply most recent stash without removing from list
- git stash apply stash@{n}: apply specific stash from list
- git stash pop: apply and remove most recent stash from list. i knew this one.
- git stash pop stash@{n}: pop specific stash from list
- git stash drop: remove the most recent stash from the list
- git stash drop stash@{n}: drop a specific stash from the list

10.24.24
- search history backwards in terminal: ctrl + r
- search history forwards in terminal: ctrl + s

10.25.24
- Added a make target called `wipe-docker` to the circuit repo that deletes all containers, images, and volumes. It's annoying having to go to docker desktop and delete these things via the ui with my mouse. 

11.04.24
- ohhhhh my god you can open the 1Password extension via `cmd + shift + x`

11.05.24
- Added hotkey for muting/unmuting mic in zoom: shift + 1

11.06.24
- Learned how to rewrite git commit history:
  - do an interactive rebase: git rebase -i HEAD~<number of commits back needed>
  - Mark the commit(s) to rewrite as `edit`
  - amend the commit's date:
    - GIT_COMMITTER_DATE="2024-11-06 12:00" git commit --amend --no-edit --date "2024-11-06 12:00"
    - Where `GIT_COMMITTER_DATE is the date the commit was... committed?
    - --date is the author date? which is the date the commit was... authored. hm.
  - add the changes: git add <...>
  - continue the rebase: git rebase --continue
  - force push: git push -f
- Yeah this one definitely happened on 11.06.24 for sure definitely

11.07.24
- finally set up my new mouse
- now I have dedicated spotify buttons on my mouse. my productivity is about to skyrocket

11.08.24
- split vs code terminal: cmd+\
- resize vs code terminal: cmd + control + arrow 

11.13.24
- bunch of vs code setting changes...
    "workbench.tree.indent": 20, 					- indents the file tree in the explorer
    "workbench.editor.labelFormat": "short", 				- not sure tbh travis said it was good 	
    "window.title": "${rootName}${separator}${activeFolderMedium}", 	- shows the file directory up top
    "workbench.editor.wrapTabs": true, 					- wraps the tabs at the top rather than scrolling forever

11.14.24
- Looked into what `span` is
- Seems to be used for tracking what things happen in a request
- A "trace" is composed of many "span"s, each span is a chunk of a thing
- I remember Julio showed me (like.... 18 months ago...) that we could see in datadog exactly what functions happened for each request and how we could see exactly where errors happened. I believe this is what enables that. 
- Seems to be disabled - I seem to remember Yasar mentioned at some point that tracing was intentionally turned off?
- Not entirely clear to me what the situation is... should we be breadcrumbing spans all over? is the idea we can turn it on if we need it? Unclear. 
- option + 2 writes the â„¢ symbol

11.20.24
aws console things...
- finally figured out how to add services to favorites (the quickbar): theres a star to click in the search bar next to each search result
- You can do option + s to get to the searchbar
- I also added the favorites widget to my main aws page... so i can click the hotbar or the widget. Not sure which will be more useful.
- You can run a make target from another directory by doing this:
`make -f ./folder/Makefile target_name`
- updated makefile to be happy when ran from another directory

11.22.24
- finally got my monitor mounted higher. its a bit scuffed. but it should mean my wrists hurt less yay

12.04.24
- looked into accessing chrome bookmarks via keyboard:
	- You can do cmd+l to access the address bar, but you can't tab backwards to get to the bookmarks?
	- cmd+option+b opens a bookmarks page in a new tab? which can be navigated with tab and whatnot. but not great.
- cmd+i opens a copilot chat inline in vscode

12.16.24
- Started a brilliant course for math
- got the app on my phone too
- seems overly basic but i'm sure it ramps up and i havent dont any calculus or anything in like 2 years so i'm very dusty

12.17&18.24
- Working on a couple brilliant courses, kinda fun.
- math, science, logic, one on how llm's work. etc
- I got the brilliant app and intend to keep a streak going.

01.06.25
- brilliant streak is 1 day
- snooped around at some networking courses online, found one I like.

01.09.25
- brilliant streak (BS): 1 day
- Continuing the networking course

01.15.25
- Watched some videos about how blockchain works
	- blocks have hashes, and a hash for the previous block
	- gotta do proof of work to prove that. you... did the work. 
	- proof of work is basically random guessing a password (simplified)
	- there's also proof of stake which is something i haven't looked into yet but allegedly it's way better

01.16.25
- BS: 1 day...
- Watched a video about proof of stake:
	- basically a random person is chosen to confirm the next block
	- you have to put up your own resources as collateral to be in the pool of people to choose from
	- if you put up more collateral you are more likely to be chosen
- Watched some videos about p2p - my biggest question was how do nodes find an initial connection to the network?
	- and the answer is that there's seed nodes. go figure.

01.30.25
- learned what P95 Latency is
	- It's the latency of the 95th percentile of all queries. used to get an idea for what the slowest 5% of queries are like. 
- learned what a WAL, dirty pages, and checkpoints are
	- dirty pages: an in memory representation of the new stuff that has happened to the database
	- WAL: a sequential list of changes to the database. it exists so that if the in memory stuff gets oopsied then the in memory can be rebuilt from the WAL
	- checkpoints: rules around when to combine the dirty pages (in memory) to the database (disk). there's a time component (ie: every 5 minutes) and a max WAL component (ie: once the WAL hits 1GB flush everything to disk and reset the timer)
	- and then when a checkpoint triggers, the WAL is reset, and the in memory shenanigans is minimized/wiped/reset.
