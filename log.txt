11.06.24
- Learned how to rewrite git commit history:
  - do an interactive rebase: git rebase -i HEAD~<number of commits back needed>
  - Mark the commit(s) to rewrite as `edit`
  - amend the commit's date:
    - GIT_COMMITTER_DATE="2024-11-06 12:00" git commit --amend --no-edit --date "2024-11-06 12:00"
    - Where `GIT_COMMITTER_DATE is the date the commit was... committed?
    - --date is the author date? which is the date the commit was... authored. hm.
  - add the changes: git add <...>
  - continue the rebase: git rebase --continue
  - force push: git push -f
- Yeah this one definitely happened on 11.06.24 for sure definitely
